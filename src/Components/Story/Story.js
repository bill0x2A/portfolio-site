            <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>After completing my physics degree at Bristol University in 2019,
        I worked at a pub and went travelling until the COVID-19 pandemic began.</p>
        <p>After writing a crucial part of my final year project in Python, I knew I wanted
        to learn more but didnâ€™t want to spend more money on education.</p>
        <p>I used lockdown as an opportunity to pick up HTML, CSS and JS.
        Within two months, I managed to find my first two clients and I became
        familliar with Node and Express to facilitate their needs.</p>
        <p>Wanting to adopt more modern methods, I began learning React in
        July 2020 and since then I have furthered my skills through a series of projects, winning prizes at the ColoradoJam hackathon and taking on the lead developer role for a small startup.</p>
